                                <h2>About The Project</h2>
                                <p>The Automated Plant Caretaker, developed by Emmet Blassingame and Blake Brown, represents a significant advancement in IoT applications, specifically tailored for enhancing the home gardening experience. Central to this system is a Raspberry Pi, functioning as the primary processing unit. It incorporates a range of sensors to monitor vital plant health metrics such as soil moisture, ambient light, temperature, and humidity. This intelligent system automates watering based on sensor feedback, simultaneously keeping track of the plant's overall condition.</p>
                                <p>At its core, the project excels in executing data-driven watering decisions, ensuring precise water delivery for optimal plant growth. Sensor-acquired environmental data is logged for trend analysis through a cloud service, facilitating an in-depth comprehension of plant requirements under varying environmental conditions.</p>
                                <p>The system's cloud-connected web application is a pivotal feature, enabling remote monitoring and control. This functionality proves invaluable for both amateur and seasoned gardeners, granting them the flexibility to manage their gardens remotely, enhancing convenience and efficiency.</p>
                                <p>The system comprises a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, an assortment of sensors (soil moisture sensor, light-dependent resistor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor), a submersible water pump, a 5V relay module, and other essential hardware. A critical aspect is the effective integration and coordination among these components. This includes tasks such as testing the water pump and relay switch, establishing Arduino-Raspberry Pi connectivity for ADC use, and precise sensor data acquisition.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the project transcends basic plant care, serving as a practical foray into IoT development. It integrates cloud computing, sensor technology, and automation controls. The team has outlined a detailed schedule spanning a week, encompassing system setup, calibration, observation, data logging, growth tracking, system tuning, data analysis, and optimization, concluding with a final assessment.</p>
                                <p>This approach not only guarantees plant health and growth but also yields insights into the efficacy of automated versus manual care. It exemplifies the integration of gardening with advanced technology, streamlining plant care while paving new paths in IoT development.</p>
